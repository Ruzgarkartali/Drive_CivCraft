Long ago, well before the dawn of the Aetherian calendar, the first immortal community thrived within the Empire of the Immortal Reign, also known as Pax Imperialis. Under the leadership of Alexander III the Fortunate, this supernatural society was united by the bond of shared immortality.

However, peace was shaken by an internal schism, and the community split into four distinct tribes, each following its own path. The Warriors, proud defenders of the Empire, ensured the nation's security. The Alchemists, masters of mysteries and potions, harnessed the power of the elements. The Prospectors, adventurous explorers, sought resources to enrich the Empire, while the Farmers, guardians of fertile lands, ensured agricultural prosperity.

In the midst of this division arose a mysterious legend: the creation of a fifth tribe, the Grands. These beings of immeasurable power were shrouded in mystery, keeping themselves apart from the daily affairs of the other tribes.

The golden age of the Empire of the Immortal Reign came to an abrupt end during the Pax Imperialis. Alexander III was assassinated, plunging the Empire into a bloody succession war between Tiberius III and Shain I, the Generalissimo of the Empire, a being half-human, half-immortal. Shain, corrupted by the Shadows sect, known as Secta Umbrarum, purged the legions by eliminating sect supporters and assassinating Trajan II the Architect.

Thus, the Empire of the Sun emerged from the ashes of war, establishing a new era of immortal dominance. However, this era was marked by Shain's tyranny, ruling with an iron fist and spreading his corrupted influence throughout the Empire.

The post-war era began with the death of Tiberius III the Strong, paving the way for a new and unexplored era. In the year 504 of the Aetherian calendar, two prominent figures, LathanDevers and Ruzgarkartali, arrived on a mystical island and decided to found Aetheria. Thus began the construction of the Castle of the Immortal Skies, a symbol of renewal and prosperity.

In the year 551 of the Aetherian calendar, the castle was completed, marking the end of an era of turmoil and the beginning of an era of peace and cooperation within Aetheria. In the year 620 of the Aetherian calendar, this year was officially recognized as year zero, signaling the start of a new era on the mystical island, where immortals could shape their destiny in newfound serenity.
