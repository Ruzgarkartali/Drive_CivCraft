I am Thorne Oakheart, a humble lumberjack residing in the dense and ancient forests of the mystical land known as Aetheria. My people, the Arborians, are renowned for their exceptional skills in woodcraft and their harmonious coexistence with the natural world. As a wise and respected leader among the Arborians, I played a crucial role in forming an unlikely alliance with two extraordinary newcomers: Ruzgarkartali and LathanDevers.

Together with these visionary individuals, we worked tirelessly to blend their innovative touch with the unparalleled woodworking skills and deep understanding of mystical energies possessed by the Arborians. This collaborative effort led to the creation of the Castle of the Immortal Skies, marking the beginning of a new chapter for our beloved land, Aetheria.
